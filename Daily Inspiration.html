<p>1Jn 2:7 KJV Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. <br />The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 
<br />1Jn 2:8 KJV Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 

<br> </br>John Is writing here that the things included in this book are nothing new, but it is something that has already been taught. He is saying that we have heard things before <br />and didn't understand them, saw things with our physical eyes and didn't see them spiritually. Sometimes we did understand, but we didn't take action.<br /> Then John's purpose in writing this epistle is to open our eyes, and add emphasis. He is also writing in a new anointing, where sometimes God has taken the eye salve off our eyes. <br />Then what is this commandment he was referring to?

<br> </br>1Jn 2:9 KJV He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 
<br />1Jn 2:10 KJV He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 
<br />1Jn 2:11 KJV But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 

<br> </br>This is Literally the next verse after, which means it must be the new commandment(or old). You cannot be in the light and hate your brother at the same time. <br />Why is that? Well, if you think about it, the same God that is in you is in your brother. That means that if God is in you, you wouldn't hate the God in your Brother.<br /> Right? You would be lying then because your brother is only the temple in which God dwells in, then all you would be doing is hating God  "Oh! Well I don't have a brother, <br />so I am out of this one at least." Your brother does not actually mean your literal brother in the flesh, it is in the spirit. Not only that, he means any person in the world; man, woman, and child.<br /> The Bible says that God is no respecter of persons, why should He be here?  The whole key is that God is one person, but he dwells in everyone of us through his Holy Ghost.<br /> Before Jesus Christ died, however, that was not released before then. So any time Jeus would try to say something to his disciples they wouldn't understand.<br /> You would think that even his closest followers would catch it, but they didn't. Why? Because they were only allowed to understand what they could for their day.<br /> They were still under the law, they were only under the anointing of bulls and goats. After Jeus died and rose again they went out preaching, and fellowshipping with the brethren, and giving their lives!<br /> Do we have the understanding of what God is trying to tell us today?
<br />God Bless!</p>
