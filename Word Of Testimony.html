<p><em><strong>1Jn 2:7 KJV Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. <br />The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 
</em></strong>
<br />John Is writing here that the things included in this book are nothing new, but it is something that has already been taught.
<br /> He is saying that we have heard things before <br />and didn't understand them, saw things with our physical eyes and didn't <br />see them spiritually. Sometimes we did understand, but we didn't take action.
<br />Then what is this commandment he was referring to?</p>

<h6>81 I—I like that. I like a good testimony meeting when you got something to testify about. Now, if you haven’t got nothing, just stand up and say the same thing you said the night before and last year, that gets wearisome. But when you got a real fresh testimony that you just can’t hold it back any longer, the Lord has done something for you, and you just have to break it out, I like that. 82 We used to call it, at home, a popcorn testimony. Now, how many knows what popcorn is? I want to tell you what it does. You take a little yellow grain, and lay it on a hot stove, and it jumps way up in the air yellow, turns white, comes back twice its size and half as light, half as heavy, rather, as it was. It’s a testimony. See? That’s what a testimony does. A little yellow, afraid to do anything, and then, the first thing you know, the power and fire of the Holy Ghost hits you and it turns you white, from yellow. And you feel so light, you just, see, you’re not anchored to the earth anymore. So I like the popcorn testimony.<br />
