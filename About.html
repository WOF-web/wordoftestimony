<p><strong><em/>The Bible Says in Rev 12:9 KJV  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: <br />he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 
<br />
Rev 12:10 KJV  And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ:<br /> for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</em> 
</Strong>

<br> <br/>
Who is this <em>Accuser of the Brethren</em> as mentioned in verse 10? He is none other then Satan Himself. You might say "how is that"? Who else is it that accuses you, <br />and tells you lies day and night? Who else deceives the whole world? The devil. Is there any hope then, seeing that Satan's influence is springing up before God <br />and his people, and he is attacking the Bride of Jesus Christ with his lies? 

<br> <br/>
Yes, there is hope. We cant stop there, there is more in Rev 12:11 KJV <strong><em>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</em></strong>
<br> <br/>
Who does it mean by <em><u>they</u></em>?
YOU! You are the one who will overcome the devil with the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony. You have<br /> the option to either bring a testimony Against the devil and claim the Blood of Jesus Christ in your life! Or you can accept the devils lie and bring a<br />testimony against God. Of course your testimony against God will not hinder God in any way, it will only hinder you! 
 
<br> <br/>

Our goal is to bring a testimony(or witness)Against the devil, especially in this hour because we see all of the devils worldly influence today. So we as <br />Christians can bring a testimony against that simply because we are saved by nothing else but the Blood of Jesus Christ. That is all you need to bring <br />to the devil as a witness that you are not bound to the devil. You are a child of God. May the Lord help us as we provide Godly testimony for the Word of God<br /> and the Blood that He shed on calvary. God Bless You!</p>
